        <h2>HTML이란?</h2>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="HTML5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is <strong>the standard markup language</strong> for documents designed to be displayed
        in a <u>web browser</u>. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting 
        languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        
        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
        and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically 
        and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
        
        <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as 
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents 
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them 
        to interpret the content of the page.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top:45px">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and 
        content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
        former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS 
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
